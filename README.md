## Data sampling techniques used/created
### Baselines
- Random Pruning (under-sampling)

- SMOTE (over-sampling)
- SVM SMOTE (over-sampling)
- Gaussian Copula-SDV (over-sampling)
- Recursive Random Projections-RRP (over-sampling)
### Proposed + devised technique 
- Intelligent Pruning (under-sampling)
  
## Learners used to test sampling techniques
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- Decision Tree
