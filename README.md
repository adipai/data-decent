Group 1 final project - Automated Software Engineering

## Datasets that we are using
- Breast Cancer (classification)
- Churn (classification)
- Will add more classification datasets - https://github.com/yrahul3910/SyntheticOversampling/tree/main/data

## Possible Data Under-Sampling/Over-Sampling Techniques that we are using
- Intelligent Pruning (under-sampling) -> Our proposed method
- Random Pruning (under-sampling)
- Random Oversampling (over-sampling)
- SMOTE (over-sampling)
- SVM SMOTE (over-sampling)
- Gaussian Copula-SDV (over-sampling)
- Recursive Random Projections-RRP (over-sampling)
  
## Models that we are using
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- Decision Tree
